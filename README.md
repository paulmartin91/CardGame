# Full MERN stack multiplayer card game

## The what...
<p>A simple, yet versitile multiplayer game that gives users a set of deck cards and the functions to do anything they want with them.</p>


## The why...
<p>There are simmilar ones out there, but they aren't very user friendly and I feel like I can add more advanced functionality like custom games, macro functions and scoreboards.</p>


## The how...
<p>Giving users the functionality to perform basic card tasks such as dealing, shuffling and hiding cards; they can play a huge array of card games without having to switch applications.</p>
